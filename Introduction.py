In this demo, we demonstrate how we can integrate job description and job design (both JDs) suggestions in the employer's user journey.
         
Leveraging LLMs, we:
- provide suggestions on the job title, where necessary
- identify if there are missing topics in the job description
- provide job design suggestion by comparing the description against the Job Transformation Maps
